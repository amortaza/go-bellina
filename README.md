}
```

<div id="blroot" />
#### Definition

```
bl.Root()
```

- Starts a new Bellina node tree
- This is done in the *User Tick callback function* (see Bellina Programming PDF for details on the life-cycle design)
- The *root* node has ID of "ROOT"
- After call to `bl.Root()`:
   - The global variable `bl.Root_Node` points to the root node of the Bellina tree
   - The global variable `bl.Current_Node` also points to the root node (for the moment)
   - The *node-cache* can return the root node via call `bl.GetNodeById("ROOT")`
   - A context has begun for the new node and further calls affect this new node
   - The context *must* be closed with call to `bl.End()` when it is no longer needed

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Pos(50, 75)  // position the node
    bl.Dim(60, 40)  // size the node
}
bl.End()
```

`bl.Root()` is almost identical to

```
bl.Div()
{
   bl.Id("ROOT")
   ...
```

The difference is `bl.Root()` sets the global variable `bl.Root_Node` to the new node.

&nbsp;

---
<div id="bldiv" />
#### Definition

```
bl.Div()
```

- Starts a new node within the current context (a child-node)
- After call to `bl.Div()`:
   - The global variable `bl.Current_Node` points to the newly created node
   - A context has begun for the new node and further calls affect this new node
   - The `Parent` property of the new node is set
   - The context *must* be closed with call to `bl.End()` when it is no longer needed

**Note** The node will not have any properties (except `Parent`) set (e.g. Id, position, dimension)

Consequently the *node-cache* can *NOT* return the node via call `bl.GetNodeById(id string)` until `bl.Id(id string)` is called.

`bl.Div()` can be called in an arbitrarily nested fashion.

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Pos(50, 75)  // position the node
    bl.Dim(60, 40)  // size the node

    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")
        bl.Pos(10, 20)
        bl.Dim(60, 90)

        bl.Div()
        {
            bl.Id("grand-child")
            bl.Pos(10, 20)
            bl.Dim(60, 90)
        }
        bl.End()
    }
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()
```

&nbsp;

---
<div id="blid" />
#### Definition

```
bl.Id(id string)
```

- Sets the ID of the current context node (i.e. `bl.Current_Node`)
- After call to `bl.Id(id string)`:
   - The global variable `bl.Current_Node` ID will be `id`
   - The *node-cache* will return the node via call `bl.GetNodeById(id string)`

#### Notes
- `bl.Root()` does not require call to `bl.Id(id string)` because the root node will automatically get value 'ROOT' as the ID


- An ID is required for every node in the tree

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Pos(50, 75)  // position the node
    bl.Dim(60, 40)  // size the node

    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")
        bl.Pos(10, 20)
        bl.Dim(60, 90)
    }
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()
```

&nbsp;

---
<div id="blend" />
#### Definition

```
bl.End()
```

- Closes the current node context
- After call to `bl.End()`:
   - The global variable `bl.Current_Node` points to the parent of the previously active context node

**Note** At the `bl.Root()` level, the `bl.End()` sets `bl.Current_Node` to `nil` since we have effectively exited the tree.

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")

        // at this point bl.Current_Node is 'child' node
    }
    bl.End()

    // at this point bl.Current_Node is 'root' node
}
bl.End()

// at this point bl.Current_Node is nil

```

&nbsp;

---
<div id="blpos" />
#### Definition

```
bl.Pos(left, top int)
```

- Sets the `Left` and `Right` properties of the current node
- The coordinates are relative to the node's parent's (top, left)
- A position of (0,0), puts the node at the node's parent's top-left corner

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    // sets the Left, Top properties of 'ROOT' node
	bl.Pos(200, 300)

    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")

        // sets the Left, Top properties of 'child' node
        bl.Pos(100, 400)
    }
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()

```

&nbsp;

---
<div id="bldim" />
#### Definition

```
bl.Dim(width, height int)
```

- Sets the `Width` and `Height` properties of the current node

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    // sets the Width, Height properties of 'ROOT' node
	bl.Dim(200, 300)

    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")

        // sets the Width, Height properties of 'child' node
        bl.Dim(100, 400)
    }
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()

```

&nbsp;

---
<div id="blinvisibletomouseevents" />
#### Definition

```
bl.InvisibleToMouseEvents()
```

- Sets the `InvisibleToMouseEvents` property of the current node to true
- While this property is `true`, any mouse move or mouse button events that would have otherwise been triggered on this node, are ignored
- If a node is invisible to mouse events, so are all of its child nodes

**Note** By default, this property is `false`.  And since the node tree is re-generated every frame, `bl.InvisibleToMouseEvents()` is the only way to set this property to `true`.

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")

        // set the current nodes to be invisible to mouse events
        bl.InvisibleToMouseEvents()
    }
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()

```

&nbsp;

---
<div id="blcustomrenderer" />
#### Definition

```
bl.CustomRenderer(f func(node *Node), topsKids bool)
```

- Sets the `CustomRenderer` property of the current node to function `f`
- When the node is about to be rendered, the custom renderer function is called to do the actual rendering
- If `topsKids` is true, the child nodes are rendered first, then the node is rendered on top
- If `topsKids` is false, the node is rendered first, then the child nodes are rendered on top

A node can have 2 custom renderers which are invoked 1 then 2 (i.e. 2nd renderer draws on top of the 1st).

The first call to `bl.CustomRenderer(...)` sets the 1st renderer.

The second call TO `bl.CustomRenderer(...)` sets the 2nd renderer.

If a node does not have a customer renderer function set, then nothing is drawn - *however* the child nodes are traversed and rendered unobstructed.

A node's custom renderer function settings does not affect the node's ability to receives events.  The two abilities do not interfere with one another.

For an in-depth example, see github.com/amortaza/go-bellina-tutorials

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")

        bl.CustomRenderer(func(node *bl.Node), true) {
            // do rendering functions given the 'node' is passed in.
        })
    }
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()

```

&nbsp;

---
<div id="bldirty" />
#### Definition

```
bl.Dirty()
```

- Sets the `Dirty` property of the current node to `true`

When a node is rendered, its image is cached for reuse.  As long as the node is not `Dirty`, the cached image is reused for rendering at great speed-up.

Bellina cannot determine if a node is `Dirty` and needs to have its image refreshed, since the custom renderer function for the node can use properties that are not Bellina's scope of understanding.

When a developer determines that a node is `Dirty`, they can call the `bl.Dirty()` function and flag the node to be redrawn.

**Note** When a node is `Dirty`, the chain of its parents are also marked as `Dirty`.

For an in-depth example, see github.com/amortaza/go-bellina-tutorials

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")

        if stateChanged {
            bl.Dirty()
        }
    }
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()

```

&nbsp;

<div id="blsettleboundary" />
#### Definition

```
bl.SettleBoundary()
```

- Sets the flag on a node that indicates its dimension and position (aka boundary) has been set or settled

This comes into play when, say, a layout plugin needs to ensure that the node's boundaries have been settled so it can be sure that is calculations are accurate.  For example, if a layout makes assumptions, only to have those assumptions be overwritten, the node will have the wrong dimension or position.

For an in-depth example, see github.com/amortaza/go-bellina-tutorials

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")
        bl.Pos(10, 10)
        bl.Dim(20, 20)

        // signal others that the position and dimention (aka boundary)
        // of this node has been set and will not be set again
        bl.SettleBoundary()

        // now, say, a layout plugin can assert that the boundary will not change as it does its calculations
        ...
    }
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()

```

&nbsp;

---
<div id="blsettlekids" />
#### Definition

```
bl.SettleKids()
```

- Sets the flag on a node that indicates its done with adding child nodes

This comes into play when, say, a layout plugin needs to ensure that the node's kids have been settled so it can be sure that is calculations are accurate.  For example, if a layout makes assumptions, only to have those assumptions be overwritten, the node will have the wrong dimension or position.

For an in-depth example, see github.com/amortaza/go-bellina-tutorials

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")

        // create kids
        bl.Div()
        {
        	// ...
        }
        bl.End()

        // signal that no more kids will be added
        bl.SettleKids()

        // now, say, a layout plugin can assert that the number of
        // child nodes will not change as it does its calculations
        ...
    }
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()

```

bl.RequireSettledBoundary()
```

- Assert that `bl.SettleBoundary()` has been called on this node

    {
    	bl.Id("child")

        bl.Pos(10,10)
        bl.Dim(50,50)

<div id="blownltwh" />
#### Definition

```
bl.OwnLeft(newOwner string) bool
bl.OwnTop(newOwner string) bool
bl.OwnWidth(newOwner string) bool
bl.OwnHeight(newOwner string) bool
```

All *Own* *left*, *top*, *width*, *height* functions work similarly.

- *Attempts* to set the `OwnerOfLeft` of the current node to `newOwner`
- returns `true` if successful

**Note** `newOwner` value of `'*'` is a special owner that overwrites other owners.
See the rules below.

### Case when existing owner is `''` or `'*'`

- The `OwnerOfLeft` of the node will be set to `newOwner`
- `true` will be returned for successful

### Case when existing owner is same as `newOwner`
- `true` will be returned for successful

### Case when new owner is `'*'`

- Regardless of existing *owner*, node's `OwnerOfLeft` is not modified
- *However*, `true` is returned for successful

### Other remaining case

- When `newOwner` is not the same as the existing `OwnerOfLeft`, then an warning is printed
- `false` is returned for unsuccessful

### Proper usage
These *Own* functions are mostly called within Plugins.  If a plugin needs to modify the Left property of a node, and another plugin modifies the same node's Left property, unexpected results can happen.

Using the *Own* functions to ensure correct ownership will reduce plugins stepping on each other's results.

When a plugin is overwritting another plugin's results and this overwritting is expected, then use the `'*'` owner to overwrite ownership and remove warning messages.

For an in-depth example, see github.com/amortaza/go-bellina-tutorials

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")

        if bl.OwnLeft("me") {
            // "me" now owns 'Left' property of node
        }
    }
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()

```

<div id="blownpos" />
#### Definition

```
bl.OwnPos(newOwner string) bool

<div id="blonmousemove" />
#### Definition

```
bl.OnMouseMove(cb func(*MouseMoveEvent))
```

- Registers `cb` callback function with a *mouse move* event for the current node
- `OnMouseMove(...)` may be called many times to register different callback functions

Since node tree is re-created every frame, the list of registered callbacks needs to be rebuilt every frame.

For an in-depth example, see github.com/amortaza/go-bellina-tutorials

See structures section in this document for definition of `bl.MouseMoveEvent`

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")

        bl.OnMouseMove(func(event *bl.MouseMoveEvent) {
            fmt.Printf("Mouse was moved over node ", event.Target.Id)
        })
    }
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()

```

<div id="blonmousebutton" />
#### Definition

```
bl.OnMouseButton(cb func(*MouseButtonEvent))
```

- Registers `cb` callback function with a *mouse button* event for the current node
- `OnMouseButton(...)` may be called many times to register different callback functions

Since node tree is re-created every frame, the list of registered callbacks needs to be rebuilt every frame.

For an in-depth example, see github.com/amortaza/go-bellina-tutorials

See structures section in this document for definition of `bl.MouseButtonEvent`

#### Example Usage

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Div()
    {
    	bl.Id("child")

        bl.OnMouseButton(func(event *bl.MouseButtonEvent) {
            fmt.Printf("Mouse button pressed over node ", event.Target.Id)

    bl.End()
}
bl.End()

```

<div id="bladdfunc" />
#### Definition

```
bl.AddFunc(cb func())
```

- `bl.AddFunc(...)` may be called any number of times for any given node


- Registers `cb` callback function to be called during the `Stabilization` portion of the Bellina loop life-cycle


- See `Life-Cycle` section of [Bellina Programming Guide](todo)


- Any `bl.AddFunc(...)` called *before* child nodes have been created, will get the registered `cb` function called before any of the child nodes' registered callback functions are called


- Any `bl.AddFunc(...)` called *after* child nodes have been created, will get the registered `cb` function called after the child nodes' registered callback functions are called


- These `cb` are called in order of:
    - callbacks that were registered *before* child nodes were added
    - callbacks registered within child nodes (followed *recursively*)
    - callbacks that were registered *after* child nodes were added


Since node tree is re-created every frame, the list of registered callbacks needs to be rebuilt every frame.

For an in-depth example, see github.com/amortaza/go-bellina-tutorials

See `Life-Cycle` section of [Bellina Programming Guide](todo)

#### Example Usage

The following example prints:

```
Hello Parent
Hello Child
Bye Parent
```

```
bl.Root()
{
    bl.Div()
    {
        bl.Id("A")

        bl.AddFunc(func() {
            fmt.Printf("Hello Parent")
        })

        bl.Div()
        {
            bl.Id("B")

	        bl.AddFunc(func() {
    	        fmt.Printf("Hello Child")
        	})
        }
        bl.End()

        bl.AddFunc(func() {
            fmt.Printf("Bye Parent")
        })
}
    bl.End()
}
bl.End()

<div id="blregisterlongterm" />
#### Definition

```
bl.RegisterLongTerm(eventType string, cb func(Event))
```

- Registers a `cb` in the *long-term* callback queue
- *long-term* queue does not get cleared by Bellina
- Many callbacks may be registered for a given event type
- Only events that are fired via `bl.FireEvent(event Event)` respect this registration

For an in-depth example, see github.com/amortaza/go-bellina-tutorials

#### Notes

- `bl.RegisterLongTerm(...)` is called usually during *initialization* phase of a plugin
- `bl.RegisterLongTerm(...)` should not be called every frame as the queue will keep getting bigger with duplicates

#### Example Usage

```
// a hover plugin might register long term listener for the mouse move event

bl.RegisterLongTerm( bl.EventType_Mouse_Move, func(e bl.Event) {
		event := e.(*bl.MouseMoveEvent)

        // wherever a mouse is moved globally, this function will get called
        // it is not tied to a node - but the event will say which node this
        // even comes from
})
```

&nbsp;

---
<div id="blregistershortterm" />
#### Definition

```
bl.RegisterShortTerm(eventType string, cb func(Event))
```

- Registers a `cb` in the *short-term* callback queue
- *short-term* queue is cleared by Bellina every frame
- Many callbacks may be registered for a given event type
- Only events that are fired via `bl.FireEvent(event Event)` respect this registration

For an in-depth example, see github.com/amortaza/go-bellina-tutorials

#### Example Usage

```
// a click plugin might register short term listener for the mouse button event

bl.RegisterShortTerm(bl.EventType_Mouse_Button, func(event bl.Event) {
		event := e.(*bl.MouseMoveEvent)

        // wherever a mouse is clicked on a node, this function gets called
})
```

#### Question

Could the plugin above has used a `RegisterLongTerm` ?

I think yes, but it is prefered to use the *short-term* whenever possible.  The idea is that all data structures are destroyed and recreated every frame.  So if something can be done with *short* term, this it should be.

Sometimes you have no choice but to use *long* term.  The tutorials cover these advanced subjects.

<div id="blfireevent" />
#### Definition

```
FireEvent(event Event)
```

#### Example Usage

```
    // Fire a key event, or even simulate a keypress!

	keyEvent := NewKeyEvent(key, action, alt, ctrl, shift)

	FireEvent(keyEvent)
```
